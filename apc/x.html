    <!-- synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence  of instructions given in the program.Each
    instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution -->

    <!--asynchronous: due to synchronous programming,sometimes imp instructions get blocked due to some 
        previous instructions,which causes a delay in the UI.Asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instructions immediately 
        and doesnot block the flow-->
